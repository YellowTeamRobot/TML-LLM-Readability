In metals, the atomic lattice changes size and shape when forces are applied (energy is added to the system). When forces are removed, the lattice goes back to the original lower energy state. For rubbers and other polymers, elasticity is caused by the stretching of polymer chains when forces are applied.
Hooke's law states that the force required to deform elastic objects should be directly proportional to the distance of deformation, regardless of how large that distance becomes. This is known as perfect elasticity, in which a given object will return to its original shape no matter how strongly it is deformed. This is an ideal concept only; most materials which possess elasticity in practice remain purely elastic only up to very small deformations, after which plastic (permanent) deformation occurs.",142,144,0,,7,7,2,-1.820296934,0.496479711,40.56,12.68,13.31,14,10.17,0.27025,0.27298,0.498605461,12.334766,-1.876361493,-1.836897303,-1.817822,-1.806208423,-1.768307342,-1.8328892,Train

He was the greatest organist of his time, and his equal has not yet been produced, though nearly three hundred years have passed since his death.

In point of temperament and disposition Bach bears a closer resemblance to Michelangelo than to either of the others whose names I have mentioned. He was stern, strong, self-contained, and so deeply religious that he was not only a Christian but a good deal of a pagan as well. A homely man was Bach--quiet, simple in tastes and blunt in speech.

The Red Sea is a very warm sea compared to other places. There, summer temperatures can reach up to 34°C, while other ocean waters may reach around 29–32°C. Interestingly, corals in the Red Sea are not only living in higher temperatures but also in higher salinity, or the amount of salt in water, for example, in seawater. You can find a range of different salinities in the ocean, depending on the region. The Red Sea has some of the highest levels of salt. Salinity is a measure of the amount of salt in the water, and the Red Sea has some of the world's highest salt levels. That is why we started wondering whether salinity could be a piece of the puzzle and the ability to live in high salinity one of the secrets of the strong Red Sea corals?
To answer this and other questions related to coral bleaching, scientists often use a coral model organism, which means an animal that is easier to study than corals but at the same time is very similar to corals.

Perhaps the most obvious is the lack of light in the caves, which are hidden from sunlight. The constant temperature in caves and the lack of sunlight prevents plant growth, which would normally form the bottom of the food chain. The two major sources of nutrition within the caves are probably bat droppings and nutrients that are swept into the caves during seasonal flooding.
The lack of light has another significant effect on cave inhabitants: eyes are not particularly useful. We believe that, when fish were first trapped in caves, those with smaller eyes were more likely to survive and produce offspring because smaller eyes helped them to save energy. After many generations, survival of fish with smaller eyes eventually resulted in fish that completely lack functional eyes. Mexican cavefish and other organisms that lost their eyes this way rely on their other senses instead, like smell, taste, or sensing waterflow. Scientists wonder whether eye loss, and the changes in other senses that accompany eye loss, influence the amount of sleep cave-dwelling fish need.",191,192,0,,9,9,2,-1.423327285,0.510212465,51.81,11.36,13.42,13,8.38,0.28142,0.24851,0.574596908,13.71615324,-0.624178651,-0.612378009,-0.76796466,-0.728358888,-0.693513896,-0.7009541,Test

These biotic and abiotic components are regarded as linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. As ecosystems are defined by the network of interactions among organisms, and between organisms and their environment, they can be of any size but usually encompass specific, limited spaces (although some scientists say that the entire planet is an ecosystem).
Energy, water, nitrogen and soil minerals are other essential abiotic components of an ecosystem. The energy that flows through ecosystems is obtained primarily from the sun. It generally enters the system through photosynthesis, a process that also captures carbon from the atmosphere. By feeding on plants and on one another, animals play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through the system. They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and other microbes.",197,198,0,,9,9,2,-1.652186861,0.466807246,32.4,14.21,14.83,16,10.63,0.26846,0.24291,0.687636853,8.410608391,-1.535806596,-1.661833869,-1.6180989,-1.694096011,-1.638392972,-1.7489895,Train

Those who live in small houses or apartments with meagre cupboard-room know that the old hanger is out of the question for them, two coats or waists taking up the entire length of the wardrobe.
The new hanger is adjustable. Its arms work on a spring. It can stretch them out to the fullest extent where space is no object, but when used in a cupboard where every inch counts, the accommodating arms will fold together, and taking one sleeve of the coat or waist on each arm, lay them together in the same position they would be in if folded in a drawer.",162,165,1,meagre,6,6,4,-0.555041377,0.475876059,64.6,11.16,12.57,12,7.29,0.18533,0.20827,0.38843368,9.077980144,-0.621359682,-0.495297384,-0.47183132,-0.557103037,-0.436440797,-0.40712625,Train

Electronic engineers are concerned with such processes as; the transfer of information using radio waves, the design of electronic circuits, the design of computer systems, and the development of control systems such as aircraft autopilots and other embedded systems. The term electronic engineering started to emerge in the late 1950s. Before the second world war, electronic engineering was commonly known as a 'radio engineering'. At that time, studying radio engineering at a university was part of a physics degree. Later, as consumer devices started to be developed, the field broadened to include modern TV, audio systems, Hi-Fi and later computers and microprocessors. In the mid to late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name 'electronic engineering', which then became a standalone university degree subject.

Rather, they preferred the idea that many natural substances—such as cellulose, silk, and rubber—consisted of small units held together by exceptionally strong forces.

After that, although the old woman didn't have enough money to buy breakfast, she longed for the delicious bun again. So, every morning she walked slowly past Mr Shabangu's bakery, sniffing the air and smiling blissfully at the mouth-watering smell. Ma Shange's new habit made the baker very angry. As each day went by, he grew angrier and angrier with her. Finally, one winter morning when he was in an especially bad mood, he stormed out of his bakery and grabbed the old woman by the arm. ""How dare you steal my smells!"" he shouted. ""You're nothing but a smell thief!"" He wiped his hands on an apron, then pulled it off and threw it back into the bakery.",192,200,0,,13,13,1,0.568668511,0.536743095,77.8,6.1,5.78,8,5.76,0.0654,0.05203,0.49203351,17.73238357,0.401414858,0.482877843,0.49725294,0.530213233,0.501154703,0.5225018,Train

Seawater permeates rock, heats up and becomes enriched with substances from the rock, like metals, sulfide, dihydrogen, and methane. Mineral-rich chimneys, around which hydrothermal-vent animals live, then form when these heated fluids exit the seafloor. During the 1980s, scientists realized that these habitats supported an unusual type of primary production, fueled not by sunlight and photosynthesis, but by energy from reactions between chemicals found in the hydrothermal fluid, like sulfide, and the oxygen present in seawater. Amazingly, some basic, single-celled microorganisms can use this energy to build the parts of their one cell. Hydrothermal vents provided the first evidence that this process, called chemosynthesis, could sustain so much life in otherwise desert-like surroundings. 
But what about the larger animals that live in these environments? How do they get the energy they need to survive? Well, many of these animals acquire their energy by maintaining close relationships with chemosynthetic bacteria.

One contribution to the vacuum energy may be from virtual particles which are thought to be particle pairs that blink into existence and then annihilate in a timespan too short to observe. They are expected to do this everywhere, throughout the Universe. Their behavior is codified in Heisenberg's energy–time uncertainty principle. Still, the exact effect of such fleeting bits of energy is difficult to quantify.
The effects of vacuum energy can be experimentally observed in various phenomena such as spontaneous emission, the Casimir effect and the Lamb shift, and are thought to influence the behavior of the Universe on cosmological scales. Using the upper limit of the cosmological constant, the vacuum energy of free space has been estimated to be 10-9 joules (10-2 ergs) per cubic meter. However, in both quantum electrodynamics (QED) and stochastic electrodynamics (SED), consistency with the principle of Lorentz covariance and with the magnitude of the Planck constant requires it to have a much larger value of 10113 joules per cubic meter.

Frogs can live on land and in fresh water. They cannot survive in salt water. Their development is by metamorphosis. They usually hatch as tadpoles from eggs, which are laid by a female frog. The eggs are called frogspawn. Tadpoles have tails and gills. When they grow up, they lose their tails and gills and grow four long legs.
Adult frogs can jump with their legs. They have long tongues that they use to catch bugs. They make a sound called a croak.

For instance, when a guitar is plucked, a sound wave is created and travels through the air. The fact that we perceive sounds of different pitch is because sound waves have different frequencies. When the string ""A"" of the guitar is plucked, it results in a low pitched sound. This is because the chord vibrates at low frequency.

The fission in a nuclear reactor heats the reactor coolant. The coolant may be water or gas, or even liquid metal, depending on the type of reactor. The reactor coolant then goes to a steam generator and heats water to produce steam. The pressurized steam is then usually fed to a multi-stage steam turbine. After the steam turbine has expanded and partially condensed the steam, the remaining vapor is condensed in a condenser. The condenser is a heat exchanger which is connected to a secondary side such as a river or a cooling tower. The water is then pumped back into the steam generator and the cycle begins again. The water-steam cycle corresponds to the Rankine cycle.
The nuclear reactor is the heart of the station. In its central part, the reactor's core produces heat due to nuclear fission.

Some scientists believe that we rub the hurting body part to reduce the pain. They call this “gate control theory of pain”.
This theory is quite complicated. However, to get an idea of it, imagine again the wires called neurons. There are wires that send pain and others that send the rubbing sensation to the brain. These wires reach the brain via the spinal cord. At some point, both wires meet and pass through a place, which you can think of as a gate. This gate has a certain width that decides which signals can go through. If there is only the pain signal, without the rubbing, the gate will let all of the pain through. However, if you also rub your knee, the gate will let the rubbing signal pass but only part of the pain signal.

Our pleasant host was a painter of animals, whom I afterward saw sharing his friend Verboeckhoven's studio, and whose flocks of sheep were very highly praised.

We all know that physical activity is good for the heart and lungs, but is it also good for the mind?

It consists in submitting to the action of heat the hydrochlorate of trimethylamine, which is obtained as a by-product in the manufacture of potash of beets. The hydrochlorate is thus decomposed into free trimethylamine, ammonia, and chloride of methyl. A washing with hydrochloric acid takes away all traces of alkali, and the gas, which is gathered under a receiver full of water, may afterward be dried by means of sulphuric acid, and be liquefied by pressure.

Michael Faraday, in his electrolysis experiments, was the first to note the discrete nature of electric charge. Robert Millikan's oil drop experiment demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge. It has been discovered that one type of particle, quarks, have fractional charges of either -1/3 or +2/3, but it is believed they always occur in multiples of integral charge; free-standing quarks have never been observed.
By convention, the charge of an electron is negative, -e, while that of a proton is positive, +e.

And I think it's no accident that we think this way. Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard-wired to be optimists. So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes, as a danger in and of itself. ""Don't worry,"" we like to say to one another. ""Don't panic."" In English, fear is something we conquer. It's something we fight. It's something we overcome. But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way? What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination, something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself?
It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.

A baby's communication is generally basic and non-verbal. Babies are not born with speech or language. This is something they learn from their interactions with others. Within the first year of life, babies say their first words, and they can soon speak full sentences. After only 2–3 years, babies are already quite good at verbal communication and are able to say what they want. This fast progress in language abilities is probably supported by genetic conditions that support fast language learning.
However, it is interesting to think that a baby has already taken the first steps in terms of language development even before birth. This sounds impossible when we know that language needs to be learned and does not happen automatically, unlike breathing or sleeping. But babies are actually born knowing the sound and melody of their mother tongue – and they can already ""speak"" by following the melodic pattern of the language. Of course, this ""speaking"" does not involve words, and the sound made by newborn babies is often that of crying.",182,189,0,,11,11,2,0.913525851,0.575202062,59.12,9.15,10.09,11,7.22,0.10454,0.07988,0.560649866,22.37593259,0.706360257,0.802556875,0.7470421,0.825025836,0.65907488,0.7499089,Train

First, TV shows started to look better and showcase more interesting camera work. Second, the growth of more available channels led to an increase in the number of shows being produced. And third, technology allowed users to record, pause, and rewind the shows they were watching. Together, these three changes ushered in the golden era of television, allowing TV shows to tell more complex stories.

In one direction, information from the senses travels to the brain, and in the other direction, signals are carried from the brain to control the muscles. The actions of these muscles are what cause the arms and legs to move. However, the brain is not always required to cause movement. By examining animals, scientists discovered that complex groups of cells within the spinal cord can control walking.

In good weather, pilots navigate themselves visually with maps.

The first kind of navigation is called VFR (visual flight rules) navigation. The second is IFR (instrument flight rules) navigation.
Under Visual Flight Rules, pilots use a map and compass, and look on the ground. When preparing for a flight they choose big visible points on the map, for example large cities, lakes, hills, rivers, roads or forests.

Similarly, studies performed in the cerebral cortex of humans with different educational levels have reported an increase in neuronal complexity as educational levels increased.
Thus, the idea is not to try to sculpt our brain to become a genius, but rather to make the most of our own individual genetic make-up through education to increase our cognitive capabilities.

In humans, one powerful method used to examine what is going on inside the brain is to record the electrical activity produced by the brain when it is active.

These tiny electrical signals can flow up through the tissues and across the skull and scalp, where they can be recorded using electrodes (small metal disks) attached to the scalp. Electrical devices called amplifiers boost the tiny signals so we can observe them more easily. This method is called electroencephalography (EEG) and the recorded signals are called electroencephalograms (EEGs or EEG signals).

During REM sleep, all body muscles (with the exception of the eye muscles, obviously) are paralyzed by neural structures in the brain stem, which prevent us from acting out our dreams. Accordingly, complex movements like sleepwalking normally occur only during non-REM sleep stages. In such cases, a small part of the brain appears to be awake while the rest of the brain is asleep.

This report would include information such as what the thief looked like and what you saw him or her do. Although accurately telling the officers what happened may seem easy, your eyewitness account can have mistakes. For example, in eyewitness accounts, people sometimes report that a criminal is taller than they actually are in real life.

The term lumps together many different kinds of organisms. They have in common only that they are autotrophic: they use natural sources of energy and simple inorganic materials to build their forms. As non-vascular plants they do not have the kind of cell and tissue structure of land plants. They are a convenient but very loose term. Only in recent years has it become clear how different the many kinds of algae are.
Algae are a large and diverse group of simple, typically autotrophic organisms. Some have one cell and others have many cells. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds.

One day, three sisters, Apiyo, Ajoh and Atieno went to the forest to fetch firewood. The girls' grandmother warned, ""Beware of Unyalego the big snake. Do not take anything from the forest except the wood."" Only Ajoh did not pay attention to her grandmother. 
The girls packed milk, bananas, sweet potatoes and water. They took ropes for tying firewood and a sharp machete for chopping the wood. Then they left for the forest. 
On the way, the sisters chatted and laughed. Suddenly, Apiyo, the eldest of them, said, ""Be quiet. We are coming to where Unyalego the snake lives."" 
Atieno called to the others, ""Look, here are Unyalego's golden teeth. Let us take them."" Apiyo reminded them, ""Don't forget grandmother's warning. We must not take anything from the forest except firewood."" 
Ajoh said, ""I don't trust grandmother. She said that to stop us having what we want. I want the golden teeth.""

These remains can include old coins, tools, buildings, and inscriptions. Archaeologists, the people who study archaeology, use these remains to understand how people lived.
Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from.
When archaeologists do fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging deep in the ground. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist's base is, maybe a university or museum. They record everything they found by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build a picture of everything that is found. As settlements (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings.

Since opposite charges attract via a simple electromagnetic force, the negatively charged electrons that are orbiting the nucleus and the positively charged protons in the nucleus attract each other. An electron positioned between two nuclei will be attracted to both of them, and the nuclei will be attracted toward electrons in this position. This attraction constitutes the chemical bond.

Galaxies have a variety of morphologies, with irregular, elliptical and disk-like shapes, depending on their formation and evolutionary histories, including interaction with other galaxies, which may lead to a merger.
Disc galaxies encompass lenticular and spiral galaxies with features, such as spiral arms and a distinct halo.

From 1929-1932, the depression worsened. Many suspect that increased taxes on American citizens and the increased tariffs (taxes on countries which trade with the United States) worsened it. Economist Milton Friedman said that the Great Depression was worsened because the Federal Reserve printed out less money than usual.

In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a ""Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"". Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions,:2 rather than following strictly static program instructions.
Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics; a discipline which also focuses in prediction-making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms is unfeasible.

It just seemed to make sense that it was going around the earth. But now, thanks to people like Copernicus and Galileo Galilei, we know that the Sun is the center of the Solar System, and the earth orbits around it.

If that rotating air gets pushed up into the storm, it can gain strength and speed. A dark cone of air may swirl down from the storm. This is called a funnel cloud. If the funnel touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.
Tornadoes can form very quickly. They create the strongest winds on the planet, with speeds that can top 200 miles per hour. In 1967, a powerful tornado struck Oak Lawn, Illinois. Patti Ernst lived through that tornado as a child. ""Our garage blew away. Our car was crunched,"" she remembered in an interview with Chicago television station, WGN.

This begins with the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Those are some very long words, so scientists just call it the HPA axis. When the brain detects stress, it first sends a message to a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The job of the hypothalamus is to wake up the pituitary gland. Although the pituitary is only about the size of a small pea, it has a mighty job. The pituitary releases hormones, which are the messengers in the stress–response system. These hormones travel out of the brain to the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys. The adrenal glands release cortisol into the body. 
Cortisol is known as the stress hormone. Cortisol is a messenger that sets other organs in the body into action. It is like the superpower of the stress response system.

Diabetes is a disease that results from high levels sugar in the blood. After we eat sugar, our bodies release a hormone called insulin, which helps muscle and fat cells to take up and store sugar. This is important because our cells and organs can convert sugar into the energy needed to grow and keep the body active and fit. As long as the fat tissue can store extra energy, everything is fine. However, if we eat too much, the insulin machinery is overstrained and the extra sugar circulates in the bloodstream, leading to disease. If blood sugar levels are not controlled, you could set yourself up for a host of complications including damage of nearly every organ. Also, heart attacks, liver diseases, and many other health problems can result from diabetes. The cells of the body can also become insensitive toward insulin and no longer absorb the sugar.

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the people launched crusades and built cathedrals. But in the Middle Ages, Christianity had only been present in Europe for a few centuries. Before that, paganism dominated the continent. Because of the way Christianity spread, particularly in Northern Europe, Europe's intense belief in Christianity was propped up and informed by the local legends of paganism. At the time, Christians in Europe saw any religion that was not Christianity, Islam, or Judaism as a pagan religion.
Although paganism, by definition, encompasses many different religions, most of the religions that existed in pre-Christian Europe had a few common attributes. These religions were incredibly local, often polytheistic, did not focus on individual choice or power, and were heavily tied to nature. The most well-known of the old pagan religions in Europe were the Greek and Roman religions, which had all of these attributes. The Greeks and Romans worshipped many gods with human characteristics.

These WM experiments show that the electric currents change depending on how much information you remember.

This suggests that what people believe (in this case, that girls are not as strong at math) may have a real impact on how children see themselves, which may in turn affect their actual performance. In one study, when a group of college students was given a math test, men did better than women when they were told that the test usually shows gender differences, but when they were told it was a gender-fair test, women did just as well as men.

The warming of the polar seas causes the sea surface to freeze less in winter and glaciers to retreat, generating more open, ice-free water. Less sea ice provides a longer growing season for marine plants called microalgae (phytoplankton) and removes more carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, from the atmosphere. The growth of microalgae provides more food for animals that eat the algae and store this carbon through growth of their bodies. The carbon stored by marine life is called blue carbon. When marine animals die some of the blue carbon is buried in the seabed, and that carbon is removed from the carbon cycle. This trapping of carbon in the seabed or in other places is called sequestration. The amount of polar blue carbon increases with climate warming. This is known as negative feedback on climate change.

Sessile organisms such as barnacles and tunicates, and sea-floor groups like mussels and crabs, need some way to move their young into new territory, since they cannot move long distances as adults. Many species have relatively long pelagic larval stages (how long a larva is in the water column). During this time, larvae feed and grow, and many species move through several stages of development. For example, most barnacles molt through six nauplius larva stages before molting to a cipris, when they look to settle. The larvae eat different food from the adults, and disperse.
The other consideration is the small size of the eggs. If animals lay many small eggs (and most do), then the young stages cannot live the life the adults lead. They must live a separate life until they have the size and capability to live as an adult. This is what the larvae do.",165,168,0,,10,10,2,-2.778515087,0.533111486,62.22,8.73,9.07,11,7.96,0.16904,0.16001,0.504860806,12.62463296,-1.954652851,-2.215520175,-2.4884307,-2.635667131,-2.242216106,-2.5253017,Train

It is usually made with dams that block a river to make a reservoir or collect water that is pumped there. When the water is ""let go"", the huge pressure behind the dam forces the water down pipes that lead to a turbine. This causes the turbine to turn, which turns a generator which makes electricity. This use of renewable energy produces less pollution than steam engines do. Some places such as Norway and Quebec get most of their electricity this way.
The way the electricity is produced does not harm the environment as much as fossil fuels like oil or coal do. Hydroelectricity is very powerful and safe, and produces no waste.
Hydroelectricity can be made very quickly. This makes it useful for times when demand for electricity is high. Water that has been stored in a dam can be released (let go) when needed, so the energy can be made quickly. This controllability also makes hydroelectricity a good match for less controllable intermittent energy sources.

When Dias complained to her mother about her problem, her mother asked her what she was going to do about it. Dias thought about her options. She could just ask her dad to buy her a lot of new books. But after doing some research to find books with black girls as the main characters, she realized that there weren't very many to choose from. According to Cooperative Children's Book Center, fewer than 10 percent of children's books released in 2015 had a black person as the main character. Recently, there has been a movement to make books more diverse. Many school libraries tend to have older books, though, which are even less diverse.

Before Amenhotep's rule, Egypt was a polytheistic society that believed in many gods, the most important named Amon. But, Amenhotep believed only in Aton, the sun god. Belief in only one god (monotheism) was a radical notion. To show his devotion to Aton, the pharaoh changed his name to Akenhaton (""he who is loyal to Aton""). Akhenaten moved his capital from Thebes, where Amon was worshipped, to Tell el Amarna.

This led to a schism in the church, into Catholics and a number of Protestant churches.
Martin Luther was the first person to translate the Bible into German. He could print copies, because Johannes Gutenberg had invented a way to print a number of copies (approximately 50-100) at a relatively low price. The Protestant reformation triggered the Catholic Counter-Reformation.
In general, Martin Luther's posting of the 95 theses on the door of the church at Wittenberg is seen as the start of the Protestant Reformation. This happened in the year 1517.

As seen in volt Hydraulic analogy, voltage can be seen as the pressure on the electrons to move out of the source. It is directly proportional to the pressure exerted on the electrons. In other words, the higher the voltage, the higher the pressure. For example, a battery of 3 volts will exert pressure on the electrons twice as hard as a battery of 1.5 volts.

Research has shown that excelling in school has a lot to do with what are called executive functions. Executive functions are a set of abilities that help you do complex tasks, such as planning your schoolwork, completing assignments, and having control over your emotions and frustrations. One of the most important executive functions is called working memory. Working memory allows you to hold information in mind and perform mental operations, for example, adding large numbers in your mind. Another important executive function is inhibition, which helps you to resist distractions and temptations, for example, the temptation to eat the entire jar of cookies. A third executive function is cognitive flexibility, which helps you to quickly shift your attention back and forth between different tasks, like switching back and forth between your homework and your YouTube feed. To measure executive functions, researchers have designed a number of games that can be played on the computer.

The latitude, ground, and height can change the climate of a location. It is also important to note if oceans or other large bodies of water are nearby. Climates are most commonly classified by temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification was the Köppen climate classification, first made by Wladimir Köppen. The Thornthwaite system, which was used from 1948, not only uses temperature and precipitation information, but evapotranspiration too. This makes it useful for studying how many different kinds of animal species there are, and about the things that could happen when climates change.

Because of these changes, the heart is not able to pump blood around the body very well, which means that oxygen and nutrients are not delivered to the body at the optimal levels. This can affect day-to-day life, and it can also cause early death.

RNA is physically different from DNA: DNA contains two intercoiled strands, but RNA only contains one single strand. RNA also contains different bases from DNA. These bases are the following:
(A) Adenine
(G) Guanine
(C) Cytosine
(U) Uracil
Adenine often forms bonds with uracil, and guanine often forms bonds with cytosine. In this way, we say that adenine is complementary to uracil and that guanine is complementary to cytosine. The first three bases are also found in DNA, but uracil replaces thymine as a complement to adenine.
RNA also contains ribose as opposed to deoxyribose found in DNA. These differences result in RNA being chemically more reactive than DNA. This makes it the more suitable molecule to take part in cell reactions.
RNA is the carrier of genetic information in certain viruses, especially the retroviruses like the HIV virus.

The analysis of obscure and intricate dreams discloses something very similar; the dream scene again pictures as realized some desire which regularly proceeds from the dream ideas, but the picture is unrecognizable, and is only cleared up in the analysis. The desire itself is either one repressed, foreign to consciousness, or it is closely bound up with repressed ideas. The formula for these dreams may be thus stated: They are concealed realizations of repressed desires. It is interesting to note that they are right who regard the dream as foretelling the future.

Psychologists call that sense of who you are identity. Your identity can involve being part of groups like race, gender, subcultures. Identity is also made up of your values and goals. People figure out their identity in two steps. The first step is exploration, where you try out different groups and values and see what fits. The next step is commitment, when you decide firmly about some parts of your identity. Exploring your identity can feel very confusing. You might be afraid that people will judge you for going through different phases or not committing to a group. But phases are completely natural. A study published in the International Journal of Behavioral Development found that people who do the most exploring about who they are have better outcomes such as higher self-esteem later in life. Confusion gives us the space to try new things and be creative. Allowing ourselves to be confused and ask questions leads to deeper understanding, more learning, and higher self-confidence.

During winter, many animals greatly reduce their activity, often finding burrows or other retreats to stay in until spring. However, these retreats are not usually the same retreats in which they were born or hatched.
One exception is turtles. Some adult turtles wait out the cold of winter under water in ponds or lakes that may freeze over. Overwintering under water can be a problem for young turtles, because it is hard for them to deal with the very low levels of oxygen (water is <1% oxygen, while air is ~21% oxygen). So, if overwintering underwater would not work, where can hatchlings safely spend the winter? In burrows, underground. But there is one more problem. Turtle embryos are not very resistant to freezing. If it gets too cold, embryos still within eggs could die, while hatchlings have a better chance of surviving. For the best chance of survival, some baby turtles hatch from their eggs (so they would not freeze) and wait in their nests (to get enough oxygen) until spring, when the weather warms and they emerge .",194,194,0,,12,12,2,-0.802163794,0.471247536,68.28,7.44,8.07,9,7.55,0.12486,0.09495,0.528577835,18.44965258,-0.317658192,-0.417551803,-0.4950451,-0.624295198,-0.390657494,-0.5619362,Train

An object with a lot of matter in a certain amount of volume has high density. An object with a little matter in the same amount of volume has a low density.
Temperature has an effect on density. When the temperature of a substance increases, density decreases because the atoms are moving all around the place having less matter in one space. When the temperature of a substance decreases, the density increases because the atoms move slower making the atoms stay in one place. Many substances follow this rule, but there are exceptions. Water is one such exception. When water freezes, it makes ice that is less dense than liquid water.
Fresh water is often used as a standard of relative density. This is called specific gravity.
The most common SI units for density are g/cm3 and kg/m3. When the numerator is much larger than the denominator, that means the substance has a higher density.

In the telephones, connected by the ordinary wires, a constant burr and click could be heard, that sound being the induction from the wires on the poles on Market Street, sixty feet overhead. With the solenoid the only sound in the telephones was the voices of the persons speaking.

Scientists from around the world have shown that adolescents are particularly sensitive to their social environment. This can mean many things. For example, many adolescents care about the opinions (both good and bad!) of their peers or friends, sometimes even more than about those of family members. One way to measure how sensitive we are to the opinions and actions of others is by measuring how bad we feel after being excluded from a multiplayer game. One such game, called ""cyberball,"" involves participants playing a game of ""catch"" with two other players. The participant can be included in the game of catch or excluded by the other players. When adolescents are excluded by other players in this game, they report feeling worse and more anxious than adults (although adults do not like being excluded either).",155,159,0,,9,9,1,0.440037783,0.495134631,59.45,9.25,9.79,10,7.85,0.15011,0.15869,0.430030862,17.09871361,0.216243516,0.187715933,0.07100893,0.170060009,0.273133954,0.20676401,Test

However, there are a few ideas about factors that influence parental care in different species. One important factor is the environment the invertebrates raise their young in. First, parental care is really important for animals that live in harsh environments, like in a desert, where eggs or young cannot easily survive without the help of their parents. Second, when food is scarce and only around for a short time, there can be lots of competition for it. In this case, young animals need their parents' help to get enough food. Last, parents may need to guard their offspring from predators that want to eat them.
Another important factor influencing parental car is the number of offspring that survive when parents are around vs. when parents are not. The number of surviving young influences how many copies of the parents' genes are passed on to the next generation.",175,177,0,,9,9,2,-0.566875418,0.456143966,60.57,9.67,10.89,12,7.57,0.11953,0.1124,0.485633211,22.75373833,-0.074269052,-0.26067899,-0.4277874,-0.289023937,-0.331818738,-0.35274735,Test

Environmental science emerged from the fields of natural history and medicine during the Enlightenment.

Related areas of study include environmental studies and environmental engineering. Environmental studies incorporate more of the social sciences for understanding human relationships, perceptions and policies towards the environment. Environmental engineering focuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality in every aspect. Environmental scientists work on subjects like the understanding of earth processes, evaluating alternative energy systems, pollution control and mitigation, natural resource management, and the effects of global climate change.

Some studies found that positive emotions could also change size estimation. For example, expert golf players estimate the physical size of the hole the ball is hit into to be larger than non-expert players estimate the hole to be.
The next question to be asked is what causes what? Do some people have an image of a big spider in their mind and this is why they are afraid of spiders?

Surround sound is characterized by a listener location or sweet spot where the audio effects work best, and presents a fixed or forward perspective of the sound field to the listener at this location.

The medium can be coaxial cable, optical fiber, radio or twisted pair.
In the context of Internet access, broadband is used to mean any high-speed Internet access that is always on and faster than traditional dial-up access.
Different criteria for ""broad"" have been applied in different contexts and at different times. Its origin is in physics, acoustics, and radio systems engineering, where it had been used with a meaning similar to ""wideband"". Later, with the advent of digital telecommunications, the term was mainly used for transmission over multiple channels. Whereas a passband signal is also modulated so that it occupies higher frequencies (compared to a baseband signal which is bound to the lowest end of the spectrum, see line coding), it is still occupying a single channel. The key difference is that what is typically considered a broadband signal in this sense is a signal that occupies multiple (non-masking, orthogonal) passbands, thus allowing for much higher throughput over a single medium but with additional complexity in the transmitter/receiver circuitry.",187,193,0,,8,8,3,-2.192688353,0.502313942,31.78,14.79,15.51,15,10.99,0.3831,0.3491,0.696629478,5.591381817,-2.197703844,-2.224478149,-2.124158,-2.10827526,-2.175936115,-2.1701546,Train

One common strategy is by influencing the host's behavior, to make contact with the next host easier.

Nezahualcoyotl also instituted a policy in the Acolhua lands of granting subject kings tributary holdings in lands far from their capitals.

A drought occurs when it rains far less in a given area than it usually does, creating shortages in water supply. Droughts can be declared after as little as 15 days without rainfall and can continue indefinitely. The longest drought in recorded history lasted for 400 years in the Atacama Desert in Chile. However, most modern droughts are not nearly so severe. In the United States, the National Drought Mitigation Center finds only the panhandle of Oklahoma and northern Georgia experiencing ‘extreme drought'. California experienced severe drought between 2012 to 2017, while Florida experienced severe drought between 2006-2007, and again in 2017. Droughts are considered severe when water shortages become common and extreme when major crop loss occurs. Globally, the Center shows that there is ‘extreme drought' in the Middle East and eastern Australia and ‘severe drought' in parts of northern Africa.
Droughts are a natural process that have occurred throughout history. The effects of prolonged drought often depend on both severity and how people react to them.

The name comes from the disease it causes: severe acute respiratory syndrome; CoV stands for coronavirus, and the number 2 was added because it is the second coronavirus that causes a serious respiratory disease.
Next, scientists examined the DNA of the virus they recovered from a sick person and the results were surprising. They discovered that the new virus infecting humans is very similar to a coronavirus found in bats (96% similarity). This outcome led them to think that the virus must have jumped from bats to humans. But did SARS-CoV-2 jump directly from bats to humans?

Overclocking allows a computer to be faster and more responsive. Overclocked processors tend to use more electricity and make more heat than those running at their intended speed. It is often necessary to install a better heat sink to avoid overheating the processor. If a processor is overclocked too high, it can damage the processor or make the computer unstable. Increasing the voltage to the processor can allow it to be run at even higher speeds where it would otherwise be unstable, but this carries an especially high risk of damaging the processor. Overclocking is usually done in the computer's BIOS setup utility. Most brand-name computers such as Dell, HP, and others do not allow overclocking in the BIOS setup utility, but custom-built computers usually do. It is also possible to do the opposite, called underclocking, where the processor is run at a lower speed than intended. This may be done to extend battery life and reduce heat output. Underclocking will not usually damage a processor and may in fact make it last longer.",195,196,0,,11,11,1,-1.550604886,0.487625636,46.08,11.28,10.54,14,9.41,0.38781,0.35145,0.714075886,19.45567221,-1.448884252,-1.497166785,-1.5504202,-1.575975949,-1.480024388,-1.553994,Test

The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and on the river's discharge. Rivers are also capable of eroding into rock and creating new sediment, both from their own beds and also by coupling to the surrounding hillslopes. In this way, rivers are thought of as setting the base level for large-scale landscape evolution in nonglacial environments. Rivers are key links in the connectivity of different landscape elements.
As rivers flow across the landscape, they generally increase in size, merging with other rivers. The network of rivers thus formed is a drainage system. These systems take on four general patterns: dendritic, radial, rectangular, and trellis. Dendritic happens to be the most common, occurring when the underlying stratum is stable (without faulting).

Biomarkers are a measure of a disease process, usually measured after focal injury. A typical biomarker would be the level of your blood glucose as a way to monitor diabetes. In TBI, the biomarkers we are interested in including tau proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, neuron-specific enolase. All of these proteins are part of the molecular structures that make up brain cells in both humans and the animal models, like the wood that holds up the framework of a house. When someone goes through a trauma or injury, these brain proteins break apart, resulting in brain cell deterioration, breaking down the framework of the brain. Let us focus on the example of tau proteins. In brain cells called neurons, tau proteins help make up the structure of the long, thin arms of the cells, called axons, which communicate with other neurons. The deposition of tau disrupts communication between brain cells, which leads to disordered thoughts and behaviors. The buildup of tau leads to memory loss, slow movement, loss of intellect, and other devastating behavioral changes.",191,191,0,,10,10,1,-3.031543857,0.648174341,46.54,11.56,12.18,14,10.24,0.32537,0.29544,0.674098835,9.638921721,-2.499007451,-2.655714275,-2.7533543,-2.850911552,-2.622675766,-2.7976794,Train

Impeachment was first used in the British political system. Specifically, the process was first used by the English ""Good Parliament"" against Baron Latimer in the second half of the 14th century.

Therefore, people with seizures were isolated and restrained. Their ""doctors"" were priests who tried to send the demon away. Not only were these treatments unhelpful, but they could also be dangerous for the patients. To provide the right treatment, doctors needed to know the cause of epilepsy. In the Middle Ages, they did not know what we know now. Today we know that seizures happen in the brain. The brain is responsible for almost every aspect of our behavior. The brain detects scents, creates our feelings, and holds our memories.",201,205,0,,16,16,1,0.105748891,0.492565489,67.39,6.98,8.05,9,8.19,0.23723,0.2018,0.63036793,25.74537113,0.243098849,0.234094862,0.22210181,0.208212048,0.153403608,0.26032814,Train

Glaciers are made of ice. Ice is a solid. But glaciers are so large and heavy that they can flow like a river.
Glaciers are found on high mountains. It is cold there, so snow doesn’t melt. Instead, the snow piles up and gets squished together, forming ice. Over many years, the ice builds up and forms a glacier.
The glacier becomes so heavy that it slowly moves down the mountains. The glacier scrapes and shapes the mountains’ sides as it moves.
Glaciers are also found in the Arctic and in Antarctica. They press and grind the land below as they move.
Glaciers have shaped the world in surprising ways. Millions of years ago, glaciers covered the desert of South Africa. The glaciers slowly moved, scraping across the desert’s rocks. Today, we see flat, polished rocks and know that glaciers were once there.",157,162,0,,17,17,6,0.490577969,0.558682556,86.97,3.5,4.45,6,6.45,0.12832,0.11775,0.47687802,20.31528207,0.570568762,0.704229054,0.7681456,0.67963585,0.637519635,0.7541842,Train

As the anticipation builds, it might seem like the sooner the baby arrives the better. However, babies need to complete important stages of brain development before they are born. Doctors consider babies born before they have reached the normal 37–40 weeks of time inside the mother to be ""preterm"". Worldwide, about 11% of babies are born preterm. Most of these babies are born just a few weeks early. A small group of these babies are born extremely preterm, meaning they are born before 28 weeks of development. The earlier a baby is born the more vulnerable their brain is to injury. Brain injury can happen when a baby is born early because the baby's brain development is disrupted. The brain injuries that babies experience can affect them for the rest of their lives.

Blondin was a Frenchman, his father having been one of Napoleon's soldiers.
A story is told of him that when he was five years old he saw an acrobat performing on a tight-rope.
He was so pleased with what he saw, that when he got home he stretched a rope between two posts, and, as soon as his mother was out of the way, took his father's fishing-rod, and, using it as a balancing pole, made his first appearance as a tight-rope walker.
He was trained for an acrobat and tight-rope walking, and came to this country with a troup of pantomimists.
While here he visited Niagara Falls, and the idea at once struck him that, if he dared to cross those terrible waters on a rope, his fortune would be made.

One of the most well-known effects of earthquakes are tsunamis. Tsunamis are huge, powerful waves in the ocean that result from earthquakes. They can be thousands of miles long, and they travel vast distances across the ocean at extreme speeds. Some are as high as 100 feet tall, although they are more commonly between 10 and 30 feet tall. Because they are so fast and powerful, they sweep away people, cars, houses, and even whole towns.

The well-known astronomer and science author Carl Sagan wrote a book in 1985 called ""Contact,"" dealing with extraterrestrials (a human-like culture outside of earth) trying to communicate with humans using prime numbers as signals. The idea that signals based on prime numbers could serve as a basis for communication with extraterrestrial cultures continues to ignite the imagination of many people to this day.
It is commonly assumed that serious interest in prime numbers started in the days of Pythagoras. Pythagoras was an ancient Greek mathematician. His students, the Pythagoreans—partly scientists and partly mystics—lived in the sixth century BC. They did not leave written evidence and what we know about them comes from stories that were passed down orally.

Polarization was first discovered in 1808 by the mathematician Etienne Louis Malus. A polarizing filter, such as a pair of polarizing sunglasses, can be used to observe this effect by rotating the filter while looking through it at the reflection off of a distant horizontal surface. At certain rotation angles, the reflected light will be reduced or eliminated. Polarizing filters remove light polarized at 90° to the filter's polarization axis. If two polarizers are placed atop one another at 90° angles to one another, very little light can pass through both.
Polarization by scattering is observed as light passes through the atmosphere. The scattered light produces the brightness and color in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light can be used to darken the sky in photographs, increasing the contrast. This effect is easiest to observe at sunset, on the horizon at a 90° angle from the setting sun.

Research has shown that, although babies are fascinated with images of themselves and others in mirrors from a very early stage, they do not begin to recognize that the images in the mirror are reflections of their own bodies until the age of about 15 to 18 months. In psychology, there has been a debate about the mirror stage's importance in identity formation.
In 1936, psychologist Jacques Lacan proposed that the mirror stage was part of an infant's development from 6 to 18 months. By the early 1950s, Lacan's concept of the mirror stage had changed slightly; he no longer considered the mirror stage as a moment in the life of the infant, but as representing a permanent structure of identity. Lacan felt that understanding and processing one's reflection was a key part in the development of identity.
In 1953, Lacan wrote, ""The mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign [two values].

Postmodernism says that there is no real truth. It says that knowledge is always made or invented and not discovered. Because knowledge is made by people, a person cannot know something with certainty - all ideas and facts are 'believed' instead of 'known'. People believe that they know what the truth is, but they will think that the truth is something different later. This is the opposite of 'objectivity', which says that the truth is always there and people have to discover it.
Since postmodernism says that the truth is just a thing that people invent, people can believe different things and think it is the truth and all be right. Postmodernism says that one person should not try to make another person believe what he believes, because it means nothing to say that one belief is right and the other is wrong.",174,176,0,,9,9,3,-0.584382693,0.476608594,68.22,8.09,9.29,10,5.95,0.10147,0.09176,0.454635248,27.94370338,-0.751983713,-0.588848675,-0.662539,-0.775186702,-0.71995156,-0.61471236,Test
